ezcli.ozdinc.org
----------------

this is the documentation site for ezcli (https://github.com/alperenozdnc/ezcli).

it's almost identical to 'ezdocs' which is installable by cloning ezcli
and running 'make && sudo make install install-docs'.

but, this website gives a little bit more breathing room and some very minimal
eye-candy. additional pages that don't exist in 'ezdocs' may or may not exist in the future.
